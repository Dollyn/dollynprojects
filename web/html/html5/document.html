			The first big rule in sales is that if the person leaves empty-handed,
			they're likely not going to come back. That's why you have to be
			somewhat aggressive when you're working with a customer, but you have
			to make sure you don't overdo it and scare them away.
			</p>
			<p>
			One way you can keep a conversation going is to avoid asking questions
			that have yes or no answers. For example, if you're selling a service
			plan, don't ever ask &quot;Are you interested in our 3 or 5 year
			service plan?&quot; Instead, ask &quot;Are you interested in the 3
			year service plan or the 5 year plan, which is a better value?&quot;
			At first glance, they appear to be asking the same thing, and while
			a customer can still opt out, it's harder for them to opt out of
			the second question because they have to say more than just
			&quot;no.&quot;
